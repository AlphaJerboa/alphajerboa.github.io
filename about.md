As a self-taught technology enthusiast, my journey into computing began during my teenage years with an Amstrad PC-1512, where I discovered my passion for computing science through hands-on exploration and independent learning.

My career started in software development before naturally progressing to system administration, where I developed a strong affinity for Unix and Linux environments. After a decade specializing in systems administration, I expanded my expertise into network administration within the Cisco ecosystem, followed by an intensive focus on penetration testing and cybersecurity.
Today, I design and manage IT infrastructures while addressing the critical challenges of modern IT environments. My current focus areas include:

* Automation and infrastructure as code
* Security architecture and implementation
* Continuous deployment and DevSecOps practices
* Network modernization and optimization
